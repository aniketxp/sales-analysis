Diwali sales analysis using python
iwali sales analysis using Python! In this project, I used data cleaning and manipulation techniques to clean and prepare the data, then used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Through my analysis, I was able to identify the most selling products during Diwali and gain insights into user personas based on age, gender, and state. These insights can be incredibly valuable for businesses looking to optimize their sales strategies and improve customer targeting.
